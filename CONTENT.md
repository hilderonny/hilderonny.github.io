# Hello world!

First things first. Everytime I see an interesting page I ask me: "How is it done? I also want to have such a cool page."

So let's make it clear: I used [softdoc.js](https://softdoc.js.org/) hosted on [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) for this website. 

Have a look into the [Documentation](https://softdoc.js.org/?GETTINGSTARTED.md) for a description, how to setup your own Website like this one.
